async function mineThreeCopperOre(bot) {
    // The function focuses on mining three copper ore blocks. It first attempts to locate nearby copper ore blocks within a specified distance. If fewer than three blocks are found, it explores the area until enough copper ore is located. Next, it checks for the availability of an iron pickaxe and equips it if found. Finally, if there are at least three copper ore blocks, it proceeds to mine them. If not enough copper ore is available, it indicates the failure to find sufficient resources.
