async function mineLapisOre(bot) {
    // The function focuses on mining a lapis ore block if one is found nearby. It first searches for a lapis ore block within a 32-block radius. If a lapis ore block is located, it checks for an iron pickaxe in the inventory and equips it if available. After equipping the iron pickaxe, the function proceeds to mine the lapis ore block. If no lapis ore block is found or if the iron pickaxe is not available, appropriate messages are displayed.
