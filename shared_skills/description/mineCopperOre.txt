async function mineCopperOre(bot) {
    // The function focuses on mining a copper ore block if one is found nearby. It first searches for a copper ore block within a 32-block radius. If a copper ore block is located, it checks for the availability of a stone pickaxe in the inventory. If the stone pickaxe is available, it equips the pickaxe and proceeds to mine the copper ore block. After successfully mining the copper ore, it confirms the action. If no copper ore or stone pickaxe is found, appropriate messages are generated.
