async function mineThreeIronOre(bot) {
    // The function focuses on mining three iron ore blocks. It first attempts to locate nearby iron ore blocks within a specified distance. If fewer than three blocks are found, it explores the area until enough iron ore is located. Next, it checks for the availability of an iron pickaxe and equips it if found. Finally, if there are at least three iron ore blocks, it proceeds to mine them. If not enough iron ore is available, it indicates the failure to find sufficient resources.
