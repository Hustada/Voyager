async function mineOneWoodLog(bot) {
    // The function focuses on mining a single acacia log. It first attempts to locate the nearest acacia log block within a specified distance. If an acacia log is found, it proceeds to mine the block and confirms the action. If no acacia log is detected, the function explores the surroundings until one is found. After exploration, it attempts to mine the acacia log again. This process ensures that the bot successfully acquires at least one acacia log.
