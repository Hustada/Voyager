async function mineLapisOre(bot) {
    // The function focuses on mining a lapis ore block if one is found nearby. It first searches for a lapis ore block within a 32-block radius. If a lapis ore block is located, it checks for the availability of an iron pickaxe in the inventory. If the iron pickaxe is available, it equips it and proceeds to mine the lapis ore block. Finally, it mines one lapis ore and confirms the action. If no lapis ore block is found or the iron pickaxe is unavailable, appropriate messages are displayed.
