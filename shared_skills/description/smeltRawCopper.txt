async function smeltRawCopper(bot) {
    // The function focuses on smelting 8 raw copper items into copper ingots. It first checks for the presence of a furnace within a 32-block radius. If no furnace is found, it places one from the inventory at a specified position. After ensuring a furnace is available, it proceeds to smelt the raw copper using coal as fuel. Finally, it confirms the successful smelting of the copper ingots.
