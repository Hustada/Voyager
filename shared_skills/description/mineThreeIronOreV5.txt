async function mineThreeIronOre(bot) {
    // The function focuses on mining three iron ore blocks. It begins by locating the nearest iron ore blocks within a specified distance. If there are at least three iron ore blocks available, it proceeds to check for an iron pickaxe in the inventory. If an iron pickaxe is found, it equips the pickaxe and then mines the three iron ore blocks. If there are not enough iron ore blocks or no iron pickaxe is available, appropriate messages are displayed.
