async function craftWoodenPlanks(bot) {
    // The function is designed to craft wooden planks from acacia logs. It first checks if the bot has at least one acacia log in its inventory. If there is enough acacia log, it proceeds to craft four wooden planks from one log. After crafting, it confirms the successful creation of the wooden planks. If there are not enough acacia logs, it indicates that crafting cannot be performed.
