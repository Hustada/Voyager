async function mineFiveStoneBlocks(bot) {
    // The function focuses on mining five stone blocks. It first attempts to locate nearby stone blocks within a specified distance. If fewer than five stone blocks are found, it explores the area until enough stone blocks are located. Once five or more stone blocks are identified, it proceeds to mine them. If the required number of stone blocks cannot be found, it indicates the failure to locate enough stone.
