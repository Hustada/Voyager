async function mineOneIronOre(bot) {
    // The function focuses on mining a single iron ore block. It begins by exploring the surroundings until an iron ore block is located. If an iron ore block is found, it checks for the availability of an iron pickaxe in the inventory. If the iron pickaxe is available, it equips it and proceeds to mine the iron ore block. If no iron ore is found or the pickaxe is unavailable, appropriate messages are communicated.
