async function mineOneWoodLog(bot) {
    // The function focuses on mining a single acacia log. It begins by locating the nearest acacia log block within a specified distance. If an acacia log is found, it proceeds to mine the block and confirms the action. If no acacia logs are nearby, it indicates that none were found. The function ensures that the mining process is executed only if the log is available.
