async function obtainAcaciaLogs(bot) {
    // The function focuses on obtaining acacia logs for the bot's inventory. It first checks how many acacia logs are needed and calculates the difference from the current inventory. If more logs are required, it locates the nearest acacia log blocks within a specified distance. If sufficient acacia logs are found, the bot proceeds to mine the required amount. If not enough logs are available nearby, it notifies that there are insufficient logs. If the bot already has enough logs, it simply states that no further action is needed.
