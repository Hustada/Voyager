async function mineFiveCoalOre(bot) {
    // The function focuses on mining five coal ore blocks. It first attempts to locate nearby coal ore blocks within a specified distance. If fewer than five blocks are found, it explores the area until enough coal ore is located. Once sufficient coal ore blocks are identified, the function proceeds to mine them. If the required number of coal ore blocks cannot be found, it indicates the failure to locate enough resources.
