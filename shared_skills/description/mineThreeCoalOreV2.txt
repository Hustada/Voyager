async function mineThreeCoalOre(bot) {
    // The function focuses on mining three coal ore blocks. It begins by locating the nearest coal ore blocks within a specified distance. If there are at least three coal ore blocks available, it proceeds to check for an iron pickaxe in the inventory. If an iron pickaxe is found, it equips the pickaxe and then mines the three coal ore blocks. If there are not enough coal ore blocks or no iron pickaxe is available, appropriate messages are displayed.
