async function mineOneDioriteBlock(bot) {
    // The function focuses on mining a single diorite block. It begins by locating the nearest diorite block within a specified distance. If a diorite block is found, it checks for an iron pickaxe in the inventory and equips it if available. Once equipped, the function proceeds to mine the diorite block. If no diorite block is found or if the iron pickaxe is not available, appropriate messages are displayed.
