async function mineThreeIronOre(bot) {
    // The function focuses on mining three iron ore blocks using an iron pickaxe. It begins by locating the nearest iron ore blocks within a specified distance. If an iron pickaxe is available in the inventory, it equips the pickaxe. Once equipped, it checks if there are at least three iron ore blocks found. If sufficient iron ore is present, it proceeds to mine the blocks. If not enough iron ore is found, it indicates that there are not enough resources to mine.
