async function smeltOneRawIron(bot) {
    // The function focuses on smelting one raw iron into an iron ingot. It first checks for the presence of a furnace within a 32-block radius. If no furnace is found, it places one from the inventory at a specified position. After ensuring a furnace is available, it proceeds to smelt one raw iron using coal as fuel. Finally, it confirms the successful smelting of the raw iron into an iron ingot.
