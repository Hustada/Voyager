async function mineThreeLapisOre(bot) {
    // The function focuses on mining three lapis ore blocks. It first locates the nearest lapis ore blocks within a 32-block radius. If an iron pickaxe is available, it equips the pickaxe for mining. Once equipped, it checks if there are at least three lapis ore blocks found. If sufficient lapis ore is located, it proceeds to mine the blocks. If not enough lapis ore is found, it indicates the failure to locate the required amount.
