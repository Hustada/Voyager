async function mineTwentyCobblestone(bot) {
    // The function focuses on mining 20 cobblestones using an iron pickaxe. It first checks if an iron pickaxe is available in the inventory and equips it if found. Next, it attempts to locate the nearest stone blocks within a specified distance. If fewer than 20 stone blocks are found, the function explores the area until enough stone blocks are located. Once sufficient stone blocks are available, it proceeds to mine 20 cobblestones. If not enough stone is found after exploration, it indicates the failure to find the required amount.
