async function mineOneLapisOre(bot) {
    // The function focuses on mining a single lapis ore block. It begins by searching for a lapis ore block within a 32-block radius. If a lapis ore block is found, it checks for the presence of an iron pickaxe in the inventory. If the iron pickaxe is available, it equips it and proceeds to mine the lapis ore block. If no lapis ore is found or the iron pickaxe is unavailable, appropriate messages are displayed.
