async function mineAcaciaLogs(bot) {
    // The function focuses on mining acacia logs to meet a specific requirement. It first checks how many acacia logs are currently in the inventory and determines how many more are needed. If additional logs are required, it searches for nearby acacia log blocks within a specified distance. If sufficient acacia logs are found, it proceeds to mine the required amount. Finally, it provides feedback on the mining process, including whether the logs were successfully mined or if there were not enough logs nearby.
